**Overview**


This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model (LLM)** for text complexity classification using **Flan-T5**, **LoRA (PEFT)** fine-tuning, and **FAISS-based retrieval**.  An interactive **Streamlit web application** is deployed for real-time inference.

**Outcome**


Achieved 86.8% accuracy and 0.74 macro-F1 on held-out test data. Retrieval-augmented prompting improved model reasoning and consistency over zero-shot baselines.The final solution was deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time, context-aware text classification.
